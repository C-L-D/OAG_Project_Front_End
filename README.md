# Between Flights application

Between flights is an application aimed at travel agents and travellers looking to define and maximise the use of their time on the layover between journeys with multiple flights.

The flight details can be entered and the data returned will include details of the airport location, the layover time between flights, and activities/services available in the area. This could be used by travel agents to inform their customers of the available options, or for the customers themselves to plan out the itinerary for their trip.

## Motivation

We feel that there is a gap in service provision for flights with long layover times, and that this is an opportunity for travel agents to improve the service they can offer. It would also appeal to people who want to maximise their time and experiences whilst travelling, and there is the potential for businesses around the location of the target airport to use this app to advertise their services to a wider audience.

## Reflections

This is really a prototype to showcase the idea of the application, and there are some stretch goals that would improve the functionailty and user-interface. Future improvements include a functioning log-in page, and the ability to save the planned activities to a list and potentially link to the external services so that clients could book these activities prior to their trip.
